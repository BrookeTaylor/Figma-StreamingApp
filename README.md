Description: This project was taken from the book, Designing and Prototyping Interfaces with Figma by Fabio Staiano. I enjoyed reading through this book and learning Figma. Having a background using Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator some of Figma came naturally but my experience alone didn't give me a solid understanding. Going through this book and designing this prototype was a fun and rewarding experience.
